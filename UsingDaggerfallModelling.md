## Search Pane ##

The **Search Pane** is for locating specific resources in Daggerfall's model, block, and location databases. As there are many thousands of models, blocks, and locations, Daggerfall Modelling makes finding the resources you need easier with a search feature.

Toolbar buttons above the Search Pane define what resources you want to search for. You can search for:

  1. **Models**. Search for a specific model by ID. Each model has a numeric ID, such as '456' or '1103'. When you search for a model ID, each ID matching your search is listed in the results area. The thumbnails view will also reflect your search results.
  1. **Blocks**. A block is a collection of models. There are two types of blocks: .RMB blocks are used to build exterior locations, and .RDB blocks are used to build dungeons. Blocks are based on a filename like 'MAGEAA13.RMB' or 'S0000999.RDB'.
  1. **Locations**. When searching for locations, enter a full or partial match for the location name, such as 'Daggerfall', 'Wayrest', or 'Sentinel'. Daggerfall Modelling will list all locations, across all regions, matching your search string. Locations in the search results pane each have a unique icon showing if they are a Home, City, Dungeon, Tavern, or Temple.

## Auto Map ##

After selecting a location, the **Auto Map** renders a 2D map of the block layout used to construct that location. This is the same auto map data you see in game, and uses the same colouring for shops, guilds, etc.

Toolbar buttons above the Auto Map allow you to switch between **Exterior** and **Dungeon** views (where available). Not all locations have dungeons. Some locations (e.g. Sentinel) contain a dungeon even though they are a city.

Similar to the exterior auto map, the dungeon layout is displayed as a block layout. Even dungeons with their twisting corridors and many layers are just blocks assembled on a 2D grid.

## Content View ##

This is where you explore thumbnails, individual models, blocks, and entire locations.

The **Content View** is a versatile and context-sensitive 3D viewer.  The various view modes are each covered in their own article.
