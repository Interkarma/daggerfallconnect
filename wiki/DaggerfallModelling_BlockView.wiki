#summary Using the Block View in Daggerfall Modelling.

_Beta Version 0.8.0_

= Block View =

The Block View is for exploring an individual block resource.

You can enter the block view after searching for and selecting a block in the search results pane.

You can also select a block when you have a location loaded by clicking on the auto map in the lower-left corner of Daggerfall Modelling.

If you are in Location View, clicking the auto map will transport you to that block in the location. If you are in any other view, the selected block will open in Block View.

Controls and cameras in Block View work the same as in [DaggerfallModelling_LocationView Location View]. Check that wiki page for more information on controls.
