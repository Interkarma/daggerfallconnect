#summary Working with Texture Files

= Working With Texture Files =

This tutorial will show you how to:

  * Open a texture file.
  * Read basic properties of a texture file.
  * Loop through all records and frames of a texture file.
  * Acquire a managed bitmap from a texture file.


== Getting Started ==

  # Check [BasicTutorial1] for steps on creating a project and adding a reference to !DaggerfallConnect.dll.
  # Add another reference to *System.Drawing* using *Project* -> *Add Reference*. Click the *.NET* tab and select *System.Drawing* before clicking *OK*.
  # Open *Program.cs* in the *Solution Explorer* and replace all code with the block shown below.
  # Set variable !MyArena2Path to your Daggerfall installation's ARENA2 folder.
  # Build and run your program by pressing *Ctrl+F5*.
