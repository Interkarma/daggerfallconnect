#summary Searching in Daggerfall Modelling.

_Alpha Version 0.6.8_

= Searching =

To use the search feature, you must first select a resource type to search for. By default, Daggerfall Modelling will search for *Locations*, as shown below.

To start searching, enter a search pattern of at least two characters and hit *Enter*. All results will be displayed in the results area. In the screenshow below, the search string of 'way' has been used. This will match all locations, across all regions, containing the string 'way'. For example, 'Goth *way* Garden' and '*Way* rest' are both found using this pattern. See screenshot below.

A match will be found if the string you entered is at the start, end, or somewhere in the middle of the location name. For example, the search pattern 'ea' will return a large number of results.

More advanced methods of searching will be added in a later build.
