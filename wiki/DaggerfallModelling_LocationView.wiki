#summary Using the Location View in Daggerfall Modelling.

_Alpha Version 0.6.0_

= Location View =

The Location view is for exploring a full exterior location or dungeon.

Every location has an exterior, but only some describe a dungeon. When exploring a location, use the toolbar above the Auto Map to set which layout you wish to explore. Below is the 'Wayrest' auto map, supporting both exterior and dungeon exploration.

The following screenshot shows Wayrest in *Exterior* mode using the *Top-Down Camera*. You can select a block in the auto map to quickly move to that block in the scene.

Both exterior and dungeon modes use the same control setup, which differ depending on camera mode.
