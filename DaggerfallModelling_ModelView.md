# Model View #

The Model view is for exploring a single model in detail. You can reach the model view by double-clicking on a model in the thumbnail, block, or location views.

If you enter the model view by way of exploring a location, the Model will take on the climate of the location you have loaded.

You can also export models to Collada format from this view. Read the Exporting page for more information.
